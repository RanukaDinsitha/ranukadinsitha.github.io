		<p1><b>How I got into Astro</b></p1>
		
		<p>I like to mostly to create react apps! But I decided to try astro and now I love it. Altough it's only used for static webpages it's cool! For me its a lot like react too. So yep I like it!</p>
		<p><b>- About Me</b></p>
		<p>I am a 8 year old boy and I first got into react and astro. When I was a grade 3 but I failed so tried again and the did it! Now I can code basic webpages in react and astro and gatsby and vite and blah blah blah! A whole lot of other stuff!</p>
